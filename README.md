# vorp_cleangun
cleaning gun with inspect script

# PURPOSE :

This script is a rework of the cleaning gun script by Le Bookmaker and Alphatule from REDEM:RP.
I made this to make it compatible with VORP and add the inspect option.

# INSTALLATION : 

Add "ensure vorp_cleangun" in your server.cfg

Import .sql in your database

# IN GAME : 

you can use admin console commands "/inspect" and "/cleanweap" to inspect your weapons or cleaning it

If you use the item, it will clean your weapon if compatible.

To inspect your weapon you have to select it and when in the weapon wheel clic MMB like the original RDR2 function.

# KNOWN PROBLEMS : 

  - When you finish to clean weapon the camera is not in cinematic mode anymore.
  - the script can't find the weapon hovered in the wheel so you have to select your weapon before

# FUTURE PLANS :

  - Fix the camera position when cleaning is done
  - adapt the script to select hovered weapon in the wheel

Feel free to use this script as you want 'cause itâ€™s opensource :wink:
